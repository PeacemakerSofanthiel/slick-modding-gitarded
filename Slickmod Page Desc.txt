Just a mod I felt like making, because I was hella bored. Will update with more content as time goes on.

Here's a [url=https://discord.com/invite/afS3F3PxHu]Discord invite link to the development server.[/url] Join if you want. I could always use the help.

[h3]The intent of this mod's receptions is to be balanced around vanilla content + its own content.[/h3]
[h3]Listing a tier means it is intended to be fought using anything from a lower tier, not from the same tier.[/h3]
[h3]( Ex. Couriers (I) is Urban Nightmare 2, meaning it is balanced assuming you are only using Keypages and Conbat Pages from Urban Nightmare Row 1 (or below). )[/h3]
