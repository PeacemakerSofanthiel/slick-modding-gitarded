simply extract this into your mod's root folder (the same folder as the one with StageModInfo.xml) and then run the executable
and yes, the DLL and config in the .zip file also need to be in the same folder for the executable to work 


this program was made by CalmMagma for Lux(field) because much like a lazy cat he didn't want to localize his mod manually

VERSION 2!!!! it now localizes card/dice abilities and ACTUALLY reads the StageModInfo of the mod meaning you can customize the 
Data folder and tear it to shreds however you want, the program should be able to keep up
