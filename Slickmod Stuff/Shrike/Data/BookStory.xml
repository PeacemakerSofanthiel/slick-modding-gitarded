        <Desc>Shrike [REDACTED] G[REDACTED].
One of the two heirs of the sparrows. A bright future for him truly was placed in front of him on a silver platter. 

Self obsession and narcissism.
Triggered through an accident he solely blames the other heir upon, that had resulted in half of his face being brutally butchered.

But when you have everything in life being passed to you with ease looks shouldn't need to matter. However. The raging narcissist is evidence against that.

The other heir was butchered and mangled by him but left alive and ended up with Shrike being removed from the situation.  Leading to him eventually meeting his wife. His wife aids him in all his fights.

For they were happy and worked alongside.  She took him and taught him to stand on his own two feet. And he mutilated and maimed her. Gutted her on the sofa. Untangling his unborn children from her corpse and carving his weapon from her remains. Thus lives, The Armed Blade.

It was not his fight. His sibling lead to this. None of this would have occurred if he was not present, right? Our eyes have been burned out of our skulls from the wings providing for us. We have become ungrateful.

We should seek to fly on our own accord. Get lost in our own breeze our draft. Instead of being glued to a wing. Burn the wings.  Burn them down, let them crumble.  They have failed us. Failed our society. Burn the wings. Rot the broken in our world.

And so... Adolebitque alas. Leads to avicide.</Desc>
