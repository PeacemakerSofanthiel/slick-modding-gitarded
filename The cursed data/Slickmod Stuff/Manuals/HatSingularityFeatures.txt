Description of new functions and effects
1. Border prison style keyword system
2. Detailed damage system in border style
3. New keywords for border prison style
4.Multiple preview system
5. Some convenient little abilities and methods

1. Border prison style keyword system
The keywords have changed from a uniform yellow color to the corresponding icon and the corresponding color, which is applicable to all original keywords and my new side prison keywords, and is also applicable to most of the content in the mod.
The new feature allows you to add custom keywords AddNewKeywordXml and add custom original keywords AddOriginalKeywordXml (due to the complexity, the same name is not currently supported, and factors such as the unity picture collection are required. This part will not be explained for the time being, waiting for subsequent optimization)

2. Detailed damage system in border style
Detailed damage, pictures and colors have been added to the original burn, bleed, demon, and corrosion, and are also effective for the new rupture and sinking.
Added new features that allow you to add custom keyword damage RegisterAnyKeywordDamage and RegisterAnyKeywordBreakDamage (automatically obtain the picture and text of your buf, if you fill in the custom text, it will be given priority)
Just use TakeDamage and TakeBreakDamage normally and indicate the keywordbuf to automatically generate it (note that you need to use KeywordUtil to register your custom keywords, otherwise it will be invalid. If not, please check the instructions for use of the plug-in)

3. New keywords for border prison style
Contains a variety of new keywords such as rupture, sinking, and shield, which can be used directly
Demonstration: target.bufListDetail.AddKeywordBufThisRoundByCard(Hat_KeywordBuf.KeywordBufs.Rupture, 3, base.owner);

4.Multiple preview system
Supports previewing multiple cards with one card, and supports customizing preview pages based on abilities during battle.
Add custom preview xml using AddPreviewCardXml
Use ShowPreviewCard, a variety of book page effects, to dynamically generate in-battle previews, and use DontShowOriginalPreviewCard to ignore the preview xml information.
To preview outside the battle, you can use the ↑↓ keys and the scroll wheel to switch the preview. To preview inside the battle, you need to move the mouse to the preview card and use the ←→ keys or the scroll wheel to switch the preview.

5. Some functions have not been installed, please discover them by yourself (I don’t need to tell you if these can be used)

The registration class methods can be placed uniformly during your mod initialization and localization process.
