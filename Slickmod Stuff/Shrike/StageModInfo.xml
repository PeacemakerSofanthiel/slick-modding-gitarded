    <Title>Reception of the Armed Blade</Title>
    <Description>Welcome to the Shrike Mod. It's a very simple 1v3 boss fight balanced around SotC-ish featuring a character belonging to a friend of mine. Affectionately nicknamed the "Dumpster Whore", Shrike is a menace not only to the City's society, but even to his own allies as well (assuming he has any). His primary objective is to conduct "Avicide", which entails maiming, skewering and goring, and burning it all to leave no trace.

Book Recipe for Invitation:
Book of a Blade Lineage Cutthroat, Book of the Thumb, Book of Liu Association Section 1
